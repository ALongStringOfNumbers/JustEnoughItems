        Example:  
        Please add support for the new StoneCutter recipes that were recently introduced in the vanilla game.  
        You can find out about them here: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Stonecutter
        JEI already supports most kinds of vanilla recipes so I think this would be a good addition.
